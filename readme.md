# Advance Programming

The purpose of the project was to apply some of the design patterns studied in the classes, as well as to apply all the concepts of object
oriented programming that had previously been learned in the "Object Oriented Programming" course.

This project represents a board game invented in the year before this development.

Essentially, we had to prepare a state machine that connected the diferent stages of the board game.
From there we had to prepare the whole underlying logic for the game to work.

After that, it was required that we implemented an observer class by hand that updated the interface based on the course of the game.

Finally we had to implement an JavaFx interface that leaned on the observer class and that also updated based on events.
